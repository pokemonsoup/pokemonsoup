ðŸŒ¼ hi i'm soup.
 she/her	

 i'm afk most of the time, i just like reading the conversations and looking at everyones skins on pony town.

 i sit on the cushion at the table where i'm most likely sitting right now while you're reading this. i sit here all the time. if i spawn in on you sorry, but i'm too lazy to move and i honestly don't care if you cover me so go ahead.

to the people who get genuinely mad or petty about me not moving - calm down, it's just a game, go outside and quit being chronically online. maybe think about why you actually get mad at this stuff? lol if it actually bothers you so much just move somewhere else.

other than that i don't really have any DNIs, you can honestly talk to me about anything. if i don't respond it's because i'm not looking at the game and it's difficult to scroll up in chat too see if you said something to me, sorry.

if you traumadump on me i'm not very comforting and i could hardly care about your problems unless we're close friends so idk what you think you'll be getting out of that.
